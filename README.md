# COVID-19 Worldwide Data API Project

This project involves the utilization of an API that provides COVID-19 data worldwide. The project has been structured into three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

## Overview

The primary aim of this project is to fetch, process, and present COVID-19 data from a dedicated API source. The project architecture is organized into three tiers representing different stages of data processing and manipulation.

### Bronze Layer

At the Bronze layer, the focus is on acquiring raw data from the COVID-19 API source. This layer involves direct interaction with the API endpoints to fetch the latest statistics and information related to the pandemic globally.

### Silver Layer

The Silver layer involves data transformation and initial processing. Here, the acquired raw data undergoes cleansing, basic filtering, and structuring to prepare it for more advanced analytics. This stage involves refining the dataset and organizing it into a more usable form.

### Gold Layer

The Gold layer represents the final stage of data processing in this project. At this level, the processed data is enriched, aggregated, and made ready for consumption by various applications or visualization tools. The data is optimized for easy retrieval and utilization in different scenarios.

## Usage

This project provides a structured approach to accessing, organizing, and utilizing COVID-19 data. Each layer contributes to refining the data further, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact globally.
